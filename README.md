# Time-Series 

Introduction

This is an Open source dataset which I downloaded from kaggle.The data
Shows the average sales price of avocado in different years.So I aimed 
to explicitly explore and analyse how the prices of avocado changes over 
a period of time. 

The Steps taken to achieve these results in my notebook was divided into
Problem statements which ran to problem-10.
The Steps are as follows:

◾ Problem(1-3): Data importation and data preprocessing 

◾ Problem (4-7): Data Visualization 

◾ Problem (8-9): Time Series & Prediction 

◾ Problem- 10:  Conclusion
