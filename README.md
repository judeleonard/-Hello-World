# Time-Series/Avocado price analysis& Prediction 

# Introduction

This is an Open source dataset which I downloaded from kaggle.The data
Shows the average sales price of avocado for different years.So I aimed 
to explicitly explore and analyse how the prices of avocado varies in 
different regions over a given period of time. Also implemented models to study the time Series using ARiMA and Prophet model. 

The Steps taken to achieve these results in my notebook was divided into
Problem statements which ran to problem-10.
The Steps are as follows:

## Steps

     1. Problem(1-3): Data importation and data preprocessing 

     2. Problem (4-7): Data Visualization 

     3. Problem (8-9): Time Series & Prediction with ARIMA
     
     4. Remark 

     5. Time Series Forecasting with Prophet
